- **Balance Adjustments**:
  - Relic sell price ratio reduced from 40% to 35%, Potion from 50% to 25%.
  - Significantly increased the base sell price of Boss Relics (750 Gold base), making selling them a strategic choice.
  - Slightly reduced Event Relic sell price.

## Build & Install

Execute in the project root directory:

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release
```

After a successful build, Mod files will be written to `publish/ShopEnhancement`:
- `ShopEnhancement.dll`
- `ShopEnhancement.pck` (if resources exist)
- `mod_manifest.json`

You can override the local output folder with `-p:ModOutputDir=<path>`.
To export `ShopEnhancement.pck`, also pass `-p:GodotPath=<path-to-godot-console>`.

## Direct Installation

See releases on the right.

Place the compiled `ShopEnhancement.pck` & `ShopEnhancement.dll` into the game's `mods` directory.

**Note:** You also need to install the dependency [BaseLib-StS2](https://github.com/Alchyr/BaseLib-StS2).
Download `BaseLib.dll` and `BaseLib.pck` from its releases and place them in the `mods` directory as well.

## Directory Structure

- `ShopEnhancement/`: Mod main logic and patch code
- `ShopEnhancementConfig.cs`: Core numerical configuration file
- `mod_manifest.json`: Mod metadata

## Notes

- The mod injects logic via Harmony; compatibility depends on the game version.
- If export fails or the game prompts that it is not loaded, first check whether `publish/ShopEnhancement` contains `ShopEnhancement.dll`, `ShopEnhancement.pck`, and `mod_manifest.json`, then copy that folder into the game `mods` directory for local testing.
